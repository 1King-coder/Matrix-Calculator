# Matrix-Determinant-Calculator

  This algorithm where developed to develop my mathematical and programming logic habilities.<br>
  
# What it do

  Remake of Matrix Determinant Calculator.<br>
  Now it can make every Matrix operation, even <br>
  calculate it's determinant. Faster and stronger.
  
  This algorithm are compound by a Matrix class<br>
  witch the main function is calculating a Matrix<br>
  Determinant, with Sarrus theorem for 3x3 and, the<br>
  main theorem, Laplace Theorem for n x n matrices.
  
# Objective

  In this module i aimed to
  create some Matrix calculations
  to learn more about Matrices and
  how i can write a code without using
  boilerplates.
