# Matrix-Determinant-Calculator

  This algorithm where developed to develop my mathematical and programming logic habilities.<br>
  
# What it do

  This algorithm are compound by a Matrix class<br>
  witch the main function is calculating a Matrix<br>
  Determinant, with Sarrus theorem for 3x3 and, the<br>
  main theorem, Laplace Theorem.
